    <h1>The Value of Money</h1>

    <p>One’s relationship with money often starts at a young age feeling the lack or abundance of it. Some families keep their money troubles secret while for others financial worries are at the root of every argument. Not surprisingly financial problems are one of the leading causes of divorce in this country. Is the reverse also true? Does having a lot of money make us happier? Why do we value money? Is it for the things it can buy or for that feeling of comfort and security? And how much is enough? Is more always better? What about status? How does what we do and how much we make define us? What do we value more the monetary amount or the process of what an individual does to make money? </p>
    
    
    
    Looking at Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, assuming one has enough money for our basic needs is it necessary to have an abundance for self actualization? How to we get to the top of Maslow’s pyramid and what does money have to do with it? Actually, many psychologists and sociologists agree that money can make us happier and is indeed greatly valued but only up to a certain point. Psychologist at the Princeton University have conducted studies showing that once an individual makes $75,000 any surplus beyond that amount does not have the same value. The stress and headache of the responsibilities in positions where salaries are more than $75, 000 do not yield enough monetary gain in relation to the time and stress associated with the position. How then does this study relate to the value of money? What do we value more money or happiness? It almost a bit of chicken and egg scenario. Money can buy happiness, that is $75,000 per year can buy happiness, but more than that and our happiness is not affected by additional monetary increments. Perhaps then money and happiness are equally valued since they directly affect each other. Perhaps the next study should be done on health and what value to we place on our health? Is health more important that money? I should think so, since it is hard to enjoy your money if you aren’t in good health. Yet, when one falls ill it is money that allows us to seek private treatment worldwide.
    <p>Money is also tied very closely to another social value and that is how we define ourselves as individuals in Canada. How we choose to make money and what we choose for our occupation is very closely tied to our identity, and some psychologists would argue our self-esteem and our self-worth. When it comes to work, it is not only how much an individual is rewarded for it, but also the title of the job and whether an individual feels a sense of accomplishment while completing their duties. The question becomes then what will be the value of money if it is not used as a reward for work? How will we value money if it is given as a basic living wage? As traditional jobs are beginning to disappear due to automation there is increasingly more discussions whether the government should provide a basic living wage. What would that do for our identity? How would a meritocracy that has been built on the values of hard work = value of money, change with a living wage? Finally, how would we answer that basic question that others so often define us by: “what do you do?”. Perhaps unlike the generations that came before us our hobbies and interests would begin to define who we are rather then how we choose to make a living, changing our values and relationship with money along the way. </p>

    <h1>GMO Food should be banned in Canada</h1>
    <p>Grocery shopping in Canada is a nightmare. In order to decipher food labels one would need a PH D in nutrition or have the knowledge of David Suzuki, for the average Canadian who is often in a rush, busy and shopping on the go, the lack of a ban on GMO food proves to be a big problem. Who truly has the time to try to decode each item they put in their grocery cart? These days companies are listing “GMO free” but foods that are GMO do not have to be labelled as such. Since 1994 there are 85 different GMO foods in Canada and increasing. </p>
    <p>GMO is not the only problem when grocery shopping so is trying to understand the rhetoric of “natural flavour”. When one hears the term natural one things that it is derived from nature – meaning pure. But the opposite is true. According to Health Canada Natural Flavour is defined as substances which impart flavors which have been derived from a plant or animal source, may be claimed to be “natural”. Thus really “natural flavour” is something that has been created and concocted in a lab by scientists and really doesn’t come from nature at all. The chemicals used to make natural flavour are derived from a natural source as opposed to the chemicals in artificial flavours which are derived from a synthetic source – in the end though both are chemicals and have very little to do with “nature” yet for the hurried consumer the labeling can prove deceiving. </p>
    <p>For the average shopper trying to consume a healthy diet and trying to understand how their food was produced and where, it can seem like a very daunting task especially since food companies can be very sneaky with there verbiage add marketing, glossy images, and catchy taglines to the mix on packaging and one’s shopping experience quickly turns into a nightmare. </p>
    <p>Travel across to Europe and it is a completely different story. More than half of the 28 countries in the European Union have banned GMO food, meaning one can shop in peace knowing that their food is safe and untampered. Labels state the facts and not some jargon that only a well-versed dietician can decipher and “organic” isn’t some fancy, crazily expensive food for the elite but all food, subject to the strict regulations that farmers must adhere to with government standards protecting the food for all citizens. That makes for a very pleasurable shopping experience knowing that no matter what you choose you can be assured that it is not GMO and for all other foods additives are properly labeled. It is no wonder that obesity rates are lower in the European Union then in North America, but that is a topic for another time. Maybe Canada should take some advice from the EU when it comes to our food and GMO.</p>

    <h1>The World in 2100</h1>
    <p> My five year old son predicts that robots will be able to take over house hold tasks and he might predict this well. His wish is that menial household tasks like washing dishes, cooking, cleaning etc.…be done by a robot so that his parents have more time to play with him. The future may indeed have this in store as robots become increasingly of a usual household item. Once upon a time vacuum cleaners, washing machines, dishwashers, and microwaves all seemed “hi-tech” so why not have robots that will shovel our snow, mow our lawn, take out the garbage, clean toilets and mop floors amongst other house hold chores? </p>
    <p>Who knows what the future will hold? From microchips in the brain to increased populations. I personally won’t be here to see it. But my five-year-old will be 88 and my two-year-old will be 85. Sometimes I wonder what life will be like for them as senior citizens? With the increase in medical technology I imagine life expectancy should increase as well as over all health. Interesting to think where medical technology, art, psychology, recreation, employment, and education will be in the year 2100. I must say that I worry that education may solely be online and we begin to lose the art of discourse. Yet with the advancement of genetic testing and adaptation perhaps education will be a lower requirement as individuals are created to be born smart and have been manufactured to have specific IQ’s, traits and even personalities? The laws of morals and ethics might be difficult to navigate in 2100.     </p>
